Honey is intended to be a unix-like OS package manager,
archive structure format for packages and http remote
package database system.

It is meant to be composed of an ansi C library and
a command line utility for now, plus a database guideline
for following implementations.

It keeps in mind the desire to stay simple and lightweight.
