# honey
  
honey is intended to be a unix-like OS package manager and
archive structure format for packages. It is distributed under BSD 3-Clause
license, see [LICENSE](https://github.com/ValentinDebon/honey/blob/master/LICENSE).

It is meant to be composed of a C library and a command line utility.

It keeps in mind the desire to stay embeddable without
any compromise on its scalability. However it isn't
meant to be used directly, you should build your
providers around it. The command line utility is meant for
shell script providers, recovery or advanced users.

## How to make and extract a package?

The format is documented in the repository. Supposing the archive name is in _$PACKAGE_
you may respectively create and extract honey packages with the following commands:

```sh
cpio -c -o | xz -C crc32 --lzma2 > "$PACKAGE"
unxz -C crc32 --lzma2 < "$PACKAGE" | cpio -c -i
```

Note: You can also replace `crc32` with `none`.

## Build

You should be able to configure and build it with:

```sh
./configure
make
```
