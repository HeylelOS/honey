The honey package file format consists
of a simple .tar.xz archive which implements
the following files:

hny/ : the directory containing all package related files
hny/setup : executable installing necessary files on the system
hny/drain : executable which drains install files (not user data or config)
Optionnal:
hny/reset : executable reseting packages' configuration
hny/check : executable checking files from packages (not the one installed)
hny/clean : executable which removes every user-related data
	because the link removal is done through the hny/links file, this scripts
	allows the package a more fine-grained removal than an extensive and heavy
	file which would have to iterate every user and configurations on the system,
	in the end, it's just a choice done for flexibility.
hny/retail/ : A directory which is meant to contain platform specific package files
