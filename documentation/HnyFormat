The honey package file format consists
of a simple .tar.xz archive which implements
the following files:

hny/ : the directory containing all package related files
hny/links : file holding the lists of links to be created for the package
hny/rmdata : executable file which removes every user-related data
	because the link removal is done through the hny/links file, this scripts
	allows the package a more fine-grained removal than an extensive and heavy
	file which would have to iterate every user and configurations on the system,
	in the end, it's just a choice done for flexibility.
hny/retail/ : A directory which is meant to contain platform specific files
