The package directory format must strictly follow
these rules:

it must be only composed of user-owned files, those
files can be of the following:
	- Directory entry (a package)
	- A symbolic link (an active package)

No entry on the packages directory can be hidden,
therefore, a name beginning with a '.' is forbidden

A directory entry name must follow this syntax:
	[name]-[version]
where [name] contains the name of the package,
which cannot be composed of the '-' character
and obviously those not supported by pathnames

A symbolic link must reference an existing package dir
or symlink in the same directory, the value of the symlink
must be strictly the same as the entry it references,
which means no trailing '/' or other characters. The symlink
in itself only holds a name value, the same kind holded
by directory entries:
	[name]
which suppose every version-differentiating packages of one
geist are compatible one to each other.
